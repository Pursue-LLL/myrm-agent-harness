"""Command hook safety gate, payload binding and approval injection point.

Shell-command hooks spawn a subprocess that the code_execution safety
family does not cover. This gate reuses the same static command analyzer
(``analyze_command``) so command hooks are judged by the same rules as
agent bash commands, with one deliberate difference: shell *syntax*
(``;``, ``$()``, ``${}``, backticks, redirects) is ordinary in a hook a
person wrote, so only the categories describing what a command *does*
apply:

- BLOCK-level threats (dangerous commands, obfuscation, control
  characters) are refused unconditionally.
- ESCALATE-level threats are refused in ``strict`` mode — used for hooks
  from third-party provenance (skill/plugin/user config), because hooks
  fire silently and unreviewed commands only get the narrowest path.
  Built-in framework hooks keep the wider path.
- The gate judges the authored command template, never the event payload,
  so a hook gets the same verdict for every event.
- Event data reaches the command only as a ``$HOOK_PAYLOAD`` reference
  (``bind_payload_reference``), never as pasted text, so it cannot be
  parsed as code.
- A product-layer approver (server approval card) can be injected via
  ``set_command_hook_approver`` to override a refusal at runtime.

[INPUT]
- agent.hooks.types (POS: Hook 类型定义，含 priority/source 治理字段)
- toolkits.code_execution.security.shell_command_analyzer (POS: 命令静态安全分析器)
- utils.logger_utils (POS: 日志工具)

[OUTPUT]
- HookCommandApprover, get/set_command_hook_approver: approval injection point
- gate_hook_command: static gate check on the command template (BLOCK always; ESCALATE in strict mode)
- bind_payload_reference, PAYLOAD_ENV_VAR: rewrite $ARGUMENTS into an inert $HOOK_PAYLOAD reference
- approve_hook_command: ask the injected approver to override a refusal
- merged_governance_metadata: attach source/priority provenance to results

[POS]
Command hook safety gate. Runs command-type hooks through the code_execution
static analyzer before spawn, keeps event data out of the command text, with a
product-layer approval injection point; absent approver means the gate verdict
stands (fail-closed for third-party hooks).
